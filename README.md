# R-Pi-Smart-Door-System

## Brief
An entrance-guarding system using Raspberry Pi, permitting door access with face, voice and fingerprint recognition, with a local touch screen GUI and a secured-login web interface for remote control over the system. 
Used Python Flask for setting up the server on Pi to support front-end web pages and restore visitor messages as key-value pair in local database.
Face recognition ran at 15 FPS utilizing multi-core coordination, 3X faster than usual single-core implementation.
